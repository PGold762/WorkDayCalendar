# Work Day Calendar

## Description

I am to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm)

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Installation

Download the files from the repo and install on domain. Should work instantly.

## Usage

This is a responsive website that shows the current date and timeslots from 9am to 5pm for the current work day. It allows an employee to enter their tasks and it saves the data to their local browser.
